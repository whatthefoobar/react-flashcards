# react-flashcards

a react.js refactor of an old vanilla js flashcard app I did for a school project.
A simple flip flashcard app currently only loading a hardcoded set of questions and answers.

Next:
- have the card just state the title of the flashcard set and a start button to begin the flashcards, either use the same card ooor use a card like div that doesn't flip but renders the flashcard component on click of the start button (this button can be between the previous and next buttons)
- rethink UI maybe, I want the card to be made obvious from the body background somehow.
